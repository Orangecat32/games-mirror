## About this repro
 - This is a work in progress, created purely for my own amusement.

    - Webpack was modified webpack for locally scoped css class names.
    - Redux added. Store shaped for multiple components.
    - Thunk middleware added

- Future features: 
    - Add more games

    - auto-play with statistics collection
    - dashboard for statistics display
    - Add some tests
    - etc...
